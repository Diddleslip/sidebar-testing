# Sidebar Testing Solo Project
### Repo made specifically to look at side bar possibilities for another project.


### Things learned:
##### The Lambda Labs project needs a simple popup-like sidebar panel that will display certain map data when asked to.
##### Multiple NPM's were looked at, but the Semantic-UI-React NPM looked the best for this occasion.
#### Steps to recreate:

#### In console:
`
npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css
`
##### Add these lines to the App.js file:
`
import {
  Checkbox,
  Grid,
  Header,
  Image,
  Menu,
  Ref,
  Segment,
  Sidebar,
} from 'semantic-ui-react'
import 'semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css'
`
##### Choose any example code from the Docs here and adjust to the best fit.
